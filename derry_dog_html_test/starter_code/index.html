    <li>Enjoys short walks outdoors</li>
    <li>Loves long naps inside</li>
    <li>Smells of meat (a huge plus)</li>

  <h3 class="bc">Bobo's Perfect Date</h3>
  <p> Bobo loves teating apart a soft, chewy toy or important human possesion with his loved ones. When he finds the dog with that perfect butt smell, he'd love to go to the nearby pond. Fish are plentiful here, and there's never a shortage of things to chew on.</p>

  <p>If you love smelly wrinkles, and you can lay in the sun all day long, please call me. Bobo wants to share his love with you!</p>
